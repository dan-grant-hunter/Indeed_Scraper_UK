“People around the world will turn to ClearScore when they think about financial decisions. We make personal finance clearer, calmer and easier to understand. We help people take decisions that create greater financial well-being.” This is the ClearScore mission, and what you will see when you come into our office.
ClearScore is one of the fastest growing FinTechs in Europe. We've changed the credit scoring and credit report market in the UK forever and our mission is to transform how people manage their personal finances around the world.
We’re a disruptive, rapid-growing business. When we launched in 2015, we quickly built momentum, receiving numerous accolades including Innovator of the Year at the Growing Business Awards, Venture Backed Start Up of the Year at the Start Up Awards and Future Fifty recognition. We now have an 8 million-strong UK userbase that we will continue to grow, as well as continuing to expand internationally, having already launched in South Africa and India.
The Team
You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our customers. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore driving strategy and key decision making which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business.
ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact.
At ClearScore, we value learning as one of our core principles and you will have the opportunity to join in with functional technology groups and to attend our weekly brown bag training sessions on a wide variety of business and technology-related subjects.
The Role
As a data analyst, you will interrogate the 30TB of data we hold to create the insights that inform our product design, marketing, operation and commercial strategies.
You will start in the Business Intelligence function. Here you will build and monitor dashboards that report on the key business metrics and to interpret their results for your partners in Commercial, Operations and Marketing. You will spot trends or anomalies and diagnose their causes and share these with the right people to ensure action is taken. You will need to use our Dashboarding tool, DOMO, as well as writing SQL queries to extract the underlying data from our Amazon Redshift Data Warehouse.
This grounding will help you technically; you will master SQL and the diverse datasets that ClearScore uses and will be encouraged to experiment with the Python. You will also gain a fantastic grounding in the ClearScore business. Moreover, you’ll gain valuable generalisable skills such as building an analytic mindset, working in teams and presenting to leadership.
Beyond the initial period you can specialise as a Data Analyst by growing your skills with an emphasis on a particular area (such as product or marketing) or you can progress along a Data Science track where you will focus on leveraging machine learning for insight or building predictive models.
Examples of project work would be:
Breaking down our performance across different products and devices to identify improvements and potential opportunities to improve the user experience
Scoping out gaps in the market and working with some of the UK’s leading credit providers on developing new products
Understanding the demographics and behaviours of our users to tailor our communications/marketing and best serve their needs
Requirements
About You
Aptitude and passion for statistics/mathematics: the majority of our analysts have good degrees in STEM subjects or Economics, however we are looking for aptitude rather than education.
Enthusiasm to develop coding skills, ideally with some knowledge of SQL, with Python as a bonus.
An inquiring mind that seeks for the insight in the data.
The attention to detail to become a quick and accurate coder.
You can synthesise information into clear and logical presentations
ClearScore is a rapidly evolving company, you need to be comfortable with the ambiguity that creates –if being asked to switch teams or projects will unsettle you then this is probably not a place you will thrive.
You want to learn as much as possible.
A desire to integrate with and protect our culture.
Benefits
Holidays – 25 paid holidays and a “duvet day” on your birthday
Pension – ClearScore matches up to 6%
Market-beating medical insurance - with the option to add friends and family

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.

You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.

Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making

Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff


It's a bonus if you have:

Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
